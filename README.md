# This is the front end portion of my little APOD app

V1 simply loads cards. I created a proxy server to hide my API key (repo is https://github.com/lilyruth/apodappserver). Future versions will have more features & slightly more sophisticated UI. 

V2 so far: 
I added an App Bar and loading screen logic and component, and a button to load more. I also added a bottom bar with link. 

There are several things I liked about building this. First, I always enjoy doing custom styling. I'm happy with how the cards turned out. I also think I did a decent job of writing the logic to both load the API and then reload it on request. 

Finally, I was proud of my loading screen. Because the API loads so fast, I set a timer so the loading screen would actually show. Of course if it doesn't fetch right away then it should continue loading. 

I enjoyed using this project to learn Material UI. It's a great tool.
